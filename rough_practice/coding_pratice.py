Q2.
Write a correct program that:

    Uses a variable called name

    Stores your name inside it

    Prints: Hi, [your name]

üëâ Use proper syntax, spacing, and print statement.

#ans

name = "Siddhu"
print("Hi", name)


Q5.
Write a correct print statement that includes:

    A tab space between two words

    A line break after

print("Hello \tSiddhu \nWelcome")
